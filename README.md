### GFPGAN - Towards Real-World Blind Face Restoration with Generative Facial Prior
GFPGAN is a blind face restoration algorithm towards real-world face images.
It leverages the generative face prior in a pre-trained GAN (e.g., StyleGAN2) to restore realistic faces while precerving fidelity.

Limitations: GFPGAN could not handle all the low-quality faces in the real world. Therefore, it may fail on your own cases.
